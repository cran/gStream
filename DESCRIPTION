Title: Graph-Based Sequential Change-Point Detection for Streaming Data
Author: Hao Chen and Lynna Chu
Maintainer: Hao Chen <hxchen@ucdavis.edu>
Depends: R (>= 3.0.1)
Description: Uses an approach based on k-nearest neighbor information to sequentially detect change-points. Offers analytic approximations for false discovery control given user-specified average run length.  Can be applied to any type of data (high-dimensional, non-Euclidean, etc.) as long as a reasonable similarity measure is available.  See references (1) Chen, H.
